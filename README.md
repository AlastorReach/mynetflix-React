React web application is being developed for learning purposes. The main goal with this repository is to learn and improve my skills in React web development. The application is a Netflix Clone. The project will work as client of a server made with Adonis JS. A mobile application made with Flutter will be added when this web application and the Adonis Js server be finished.

The functionality of tha whole projects will be shown series and movies from a local server. If you have videos on your computer you will be able to upload and administrate videos from the web application.

For now, this project is under development. Maybe if you look some code could seem unorder, it will be ordered and improved while the project is developed.
